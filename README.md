# Tree-based-models
Classification algorithms using different Tree based algoritms

1. Decision Trees -- Titanic survival prediction
2. Ensemble algorithms - 

    Bagging - Random Forest 
                -- Removing the overfitting with Random Forest
    
    Boosting - XGBoost (Gradient Boosting) 
                -- Solving the Titanic survival with XGBoost by setting the hyperparameters
